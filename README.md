# Arduino Project: LED Blinker (Example)

## Overview
This project is my first step into Arduino programming. It demonstrates basic control of LEDs using digital pins, timing functions, and control loops
---

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- 1 LED (any color)  
- 220Ω resistor  
- Breadboard and jumper wires  

---

## Circuit Connection
- **Pin 7** → LED long leg (anode)  
- **LED short leg (cathode)** → 220Ω resistor → **GND**  
- Circuit flow: `Pin 7 → LED → resistor → GND`
